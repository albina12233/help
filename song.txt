Revolving doors what have I done
Someone on the TV attempting love
Revolving doors what will I become
A redneck song
Paid up for a seven
But he only got an eight now, now
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I see no wrong, yeah
On a foggy day
Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
I sit in a diner
And the Beatles play
